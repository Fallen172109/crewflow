## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Database Migration

1. **Run the admin system migration** in your Supabase SQL editor:
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste the contents of database/migrations/add_admin_system.sql
   ```

2. **Verify the migration** by checking that these tables exist:
   - `users` table has a `role` column
   - `admin_audit_log` table exists
   - Admin RLS policies are active

### Step 2: Environment Variables

Add these environment variables to your `.env.local` and production environment:

```env
# Admin System Configuration
ADMIN_PROMOTION_KEY=your-super-secure-admin-key-here

# Make sure you have these existing variables
SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key
```

**Important**: Choose a strong, unique `ADMIN_PROMOTION_KEY` and keep it secure!

### Step 3: Promote Your Account to Admin

#### Option A: Using the Web Interface (Recommended)

1. **Make sure you have a user account** in CrewFlow
2. **Navigate to** `/admin-setup` in your browser
3. **Enter your admin promotion key** and submit
4. **You'll be redirected** to the admin dashboard

#### Option B: Using Supabase SQL Editor

```sql
-- Replace 'your-email@example.com' with your actual email
SELECT public.promote_to_admin('your-email@example.com');

-- Verify the promotion worked
SELECT email, role FROM public.users WHERE role = 'admin';
```

### Step 4: Access Your Admin Dashboard

Once promoted, you can access the admin dashboard at:
- **Admin Dashboard**: `/admin`
- **User Management**: `/admin/users`
- **Analytics**: `/admin/analytics`
- **System Settings**: `/admin/system`

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Multi-Layer Protection
1. **Database Level**: RLS policies ensure only admins can access admin data
2. **API Level**: Admin routes verify role before allowing access
3. **UI Level**: Admin components check permissions
4. **Middleware**: Route protection for `/admin/*` paths

### Audit Logging
Every admin action is logged with:
- Admin user ID and email
- Action performed
- Target user (if applicable)
- Timestamp and IP address
- Additional context details

### Role Verification
- Admin status is verified at multiple levels
- Non-admin users are redirected away from admin areas
- Admin functions require proper authentication
