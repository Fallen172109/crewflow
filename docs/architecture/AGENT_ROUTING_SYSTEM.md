## How It Works

### 1. Domain Analysis
When a user sends a message, the system:
- Analyzes the message for domain-specific keywords
- Calculates confidence scores for each domain
- Determines the primary domain and complexity level
- Decides if specialist expertise is required

### 2. Referral Decision
The system evaluates:
- Current agent's specialization vs. detected domain
- Question complexity and confidence level
- Availability of suitable specialist agents
- Whether the question requires specialized tools/knowledge

### 3. Response Generation
If referral is needed:
- Generates maritime-themed referral response
- Explains why the specialist is better suited
- Provides clear call-to-action to visit specialist
- Tracks the referral for analytics

### 4. Analytics Tracking
All referrals are tracked with:
- Source and target agent information
- Original message and detected domain
- Confidence scores and referral reasons
- Timestamp and user context

## Example Referral Responses

### Social Media Question to Coral
**User**: "I need help creating a comprehensive Instagram marketing strategy with content calendar and engagement optimization"

**Coral's Response**: 
> "Ahoy! While I can provide some guidance on this topic, our specialist **Splash** is your best navigator for specialized social media expertise and tools. They have the maritime skills and specialized tools designed specifically for this type of challenge. You can find Splash in your crew dashboard - they'll chart the perfect course for your social media needs!"

### Financial Question to Splash
**User**: "Can you help me analyze our quarterly budget and create financial forecasts?"

**Splash's Response**:
> "I can offer some initial direction, but **Ledger** is the crew member you want for this voyage! They specialize in specialized finance expertise and tools and have the right tools to help you navigate these waters successfully. Set sail to Ledger's station in your dashboard for expert guidance."

## Configuration

### Domain Keywords
The system uses comprehensive keyword mappings for each domain:

```typescript

  finance: ['budget', 'financial', 'roi', 'cash flow', ...],
  technical: ['API', 'integration', 'troubleshooting', 'system', ...],
  // ... more domains
}
