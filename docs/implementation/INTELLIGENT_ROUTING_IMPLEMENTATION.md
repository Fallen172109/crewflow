## 🚢 How It Works

### 1. Domain Detection
When a user sends a message, the system:
- Analyzes message content for domain-specific keywords
- Calculates confidence scores for each domain (social, finance, technical, etc.)
- Determines question complexity (basic, intermediate, advanced)
- Identifies if specialist expertise is required

### 2. Intelligent Referral Decision
The system evaluates:
- Current agent's specialization vs. detected domain
- Question complexity and confidence thresholds
- Availability of suitable specialist agents
- Whether referral would provide better user experience

### 3. Maritime-Themed Response
If referral is appropriate:
- Generates contextual referral response maintaining maritime personality
- Explains why the specialist is better suited for the task
- Provides clear navigation to the specialist agent
- Tracks the referral event for analytics

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE agent_referrals (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  source_agent_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  target_agent_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  original_message TEXT NOT NULL,
