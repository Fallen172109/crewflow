# 📧 CrewFlow Email Configuration Guide

## 🚨 Issue Summary
The email confirmation system in CrewFlow was not working because **no SMTP provider was configured** in Supabase. Users were seeing success messages but no emails were actually being sent.

## ✅ What Has Been Fixed
1. **SMTP Configuration**: Gmail SMTP settings have been configured in Supabase
2. **Email Templates**: Updated with CrewFlow maritime branding and styling
3. **Email Subject**: Changed to "🚢 Welcome to CrewFlow - Confirm Your Account"
4. **Email Content**: Beautiful HTML template with orange/black CrewFlow theme

## ⚠️ Current Issue - EMAILS NOT BEING SENT
Despite SMTP configuration, emails are not being sent. Resend dashboard shows 0 emails sent, indicating Supabase is not connecting to Resend properly.

**Root Cause**: Likely domain verification issue with Resend SMTP.

## 🔧 Complete Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Gmail SMTP (Quick Setup for Development)

#### Step 1: Create Gmail Account
1. Go to [Gmail](https://gmail.com) and create a new account
2. Suggested email: `crewflow.noreply@gmail.com` (or similar)
3. Use a strong password and save the credentials

#### Step 2: Enable 2-Factor Authentication
1. Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Enable 2-Step Verification
3. Follow the setup process

#### Step 3: Generate App Password
1. In Google Account Security, go to "2-Step Verification"
2. Scroll down to "App passwords"
3. Click "Generate app password"
4. Select "Mail" as the app
5. Copy the 16-character app password (e.g., `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

#### Step 4: Update Supabase SMTP Password
Run this command to update the SMTP password in Supabase:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_APP_PASSWORD with the actual 16-character password from Gmail
curl -X PATCH \
  https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/bmlieuyijpgxdhvicpsf/config/auth \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"smtp_pass": "YOUR_APP_PASSWORD"}'
```

Or use the Supabase dashboard:
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select CrewFlowNEW project
3. Go to Authentication > Settings
4. Scroll to "SMTP Settings"
5. Update the password field with your App Password

### Option 2: Resend (Recommended for Production)

#### Why Resend?
- ✅ 3,000 emails/month free tier
- ✅ Developer-friendly API
- ✅ Better deliverability than Gmail
- ✅ Professional email infrastructure
- ✅ Easy integration with Supabase

#### Setup Steps:
1. Sign up at [Resend](https://resend.com)
2. Verify your domain (or use resend.dev for testing)
3. Get your API key from the dashboard
4. Update Supabase SMTP settings:
   - Host: `smtp.resend.com`
   - Port: `587`
   - Username: `resend`
   - Password: `YOUR_RESEND_API_KEY`
   - From Email: `noreply@yourdomain.com` (or `noreply@resend.dev`)

## 🧪 Testing the Email System

### Test 1: Sign Up Flow
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/auth/signup`
2. Use a real email address you can access
3. Complete the signup form
4. Check your email inbox (and spam folder)
5. You should receive a beautifully styled CrewFlow confirmation email

### Test 2: Email Content Verification
The email should contain:
- ✅ CrewFlow branding with orange/black theme
- ✅ Maritime emoji (🚢) in subject line
- ✅ Professional HTML styling
- ✅ Clear "Confirm Your Account" button
- ✅ Fallback confirmation link

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### No Email Received
1. **Check SMTP Password**: Ensure the App Password is correct
2. **Check Spam Folder**: Gmail might filter the emails
3. **Verify Gmail Account**: Ensure 2FA is enabled and App Password is generated
4. **Check Rate Limits**: Gmail has sending limits for new accounts

### Email Looks Wrong
1. **Template Issue**: The HTML template should render with CrewFlow styling
2. **Client Support**: Some email clients don't support all CSS

### Authentication Errors
1. **Invalid Credentials**: Double-check the Gmail App Password
2. **2FA Required**: Gmail requires 2-Factor Authentication for App Passwords
3. **Account Locked**: Gmail might temporarily lock accounts with suspicious activity
