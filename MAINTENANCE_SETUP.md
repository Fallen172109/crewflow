# CrewFlow Maintenance Mode Setup

## üîí Site Protection Options

Your CrewFlow site is now equipped with multiple protection options during development:

### Option 1: Environment-Based Maintenance Mode (Implemented)

I've implemented a custom maintenance mode system that you can control via environment variables.

**How it works:**
- When `MAINTENANCE_MODE=true`, visitors see a beautiful maintenance page
- Authorized users can enter the password `CrewFlow2024!` to access the site
- Access is stored in the browser session

**To Enable/Disable:**

1. **In Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to your CrewFlow project settings
   - Navigate to Environment Variables
   - Add these variables:
     ```
     MAINTENANCE_MODE=true
     MAINTENANCE_PASSWORD=CrewFlow2024!
     ```
   - Redeploy your site

2. **To Disable Later:**
   - Change `MAINTENANCE_MODE=false` in Vercel
   - Or remove the variable entirely
   - Redeploy

### Option 2: Vercel Password Protection (Recommended for Simplicity)

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your CrewFlow project
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí General
4. Scroll to "Password Protection"
5. Enable and set a password
6. Anyone visiting needs this password

### Option 3: Make Repository Private + Vercel Preview URLs

1. Make your GitHub repository private
2. Use Vercel's preview URLs for testing
3. Only share preview URLs with trusted people

## üöÄ Current Setup

‚úÖ Maintenance mode components created
‚úÖ API endpoint for password verification
‚úÖ Environment variables configured
‚úÖ Beautiful maritime-themed maintenance page

## üîß Next Steps

1. **Choose your protection method** (I recommend Option 1 or 2)
2. **Set environment variables in Vercel** if using maintenance mode
3. **Test the protection** by visiting your site
4. **Continue development** - you can toggle maintenance mode on/off anytime

## üé® Maintenance Page Features

- Maritime-themed design matching your brand
- Password protection with session storage
- Loading states and error handling
- Responsive design
- Professional "coming soon" messaging
- Developer access portal

## üìù Password Information

**Current Password:** `CrewFlow2024!`

You can change this by updating the `MAINTENANCE_PASSWORD` environment variable in Vercel.

## üîÑ To Deploy Changes

After setting up environment variables in Vercel:

```bash
# Push any additional changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add maintenance mode protection"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically redeploy with the new environment variables.

**Need help?** The maintenance mode is fully implemented and ready to use. Just set the environment variables in Vercel and your site will be protected!
